# wt-tracker

High-performance WebTorrent tracker.

WebTorrent tracker is a required component of [WebTorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent) and [P2P Media Loader](https://github.com/Novage/p2p-media-loader) (peer-to-peer networks for web browsers) to do [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC) signaling - exchanging connection data (i.e. [SDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol)) between peers - joining them into swarms.

## Features

- handles more than 40k WebSocket Secure (HTTPS) peers on a VPS with only 2 GiB memory and 1 virtual CPU thanks to [uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js) I/O backend and perfomance optimizations in the code
- handles ws:// (HTTP) and wss:// (HTTPS) connections simultaneously
- IPv4 and IPv6 support
- robust and well-tested: CI, unit tests, static code analyzis, 100% TypeScript
- supports tracker "scrape" extension
- statistics under /stats.json URL
